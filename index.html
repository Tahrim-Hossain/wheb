<h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Cows are a relatively large animal in minecraft, with adults being 1.4 blocks tall and 0.9 blocks wide. All cows are mainly brown with grey patches. Also all cows have two horns on their head and udders underneath their stomach, and they have 10 health points.</p>
  <p>For a more detailed description, check out the <a href="https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Cow">Minecraft Cow Wiki</a>.</p> 
<h2>Behavior and Interactions</h2>
  <p>Cows spawn on grass blcoks at a light level of 9 and with two air blcoks above the grass block. When they spawn they can come in heards and there is a 5% chance a spawning cow will be a baby. All cows can be fed wheat which will heal health if the cow is wounded but also wheat puts adult cows in breeding mode, and speeds up the growing process of baby cows. Adult cows can be bred to make baby cows, and these baby cows and the naturally spawning baby cows evertually grow up into adult cows, even without wheat. Adult cows can be right-clicked with an empty bucket in the hand, and this will convert the empty bucket into a bucket of milk. All cows can be hit and if they do not die after being hit they will run around quickly and sporadically for a couple seconds. If killed, all cows will drop xp, but only adult cows will drop raw beef and leather. All cows can be named by nametags, hooked onto a lead or fishing rod, and fit into a minecarft or boat.</p>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
  <p>Along with the other minecraft animals, cows are likely to be your first food sourse when starting a survival world. After a little bit of time, depending on your goals and play style it may be usefull keep killing every cow that spawns natuarlly, lure a couple cows into an enclosed space and breed some and kill some continuously, or to forget about cows and other animals in favor of crops for food. In the late game expensive foods, like golden carrots, will be more easily accessible and will be a better choice than cows. However in the mid-game a semi-automated cow farm can be a very useful source of decent food, and in bonus some leather.
